1/ What is the HTTP API for this?

$BASE_URL/

* Create a new game:
POST /game
  get back a game-id (xxxx)

-v gives response code and more info on the req

  curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/game
  GET is the default for curl
  2053f2cd-c692-49b7-ab36-3f398c98f3ba
  curl -v http://localhost:8080/game/doesnt-exist
  curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/game/


* Get the current state of a game
GET /game/{game-id}
  -> text, eg:
//        x |__|__
//        __|__|__
//          |   |
O to play

  -> json (can do this later, for web front-end)


* Make a move
POST /game/{game-id}/{piece}/{position}
display the current state of the game once you moved?

  -> text, eg:
 x |___|_O_
_O_|_X_|___
   |   | X
X has won
game logic:
if 123, 147, etc... then {position} won


  -> errors. it's not your turn, that space isn't available, the game is finished (409).
  -> that game doesn't exist (404)
