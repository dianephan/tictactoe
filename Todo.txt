1/ Playing on a cell which is not EMPTY should return an error
1.5/ Games should finish
1.5.1/ We need to work out whether a move has won the game
1.5.2/ We need to store somewhere what the state of a game is
2/ Playing in a game which is finished should return an error
3/ Playing X when it's O's turn should be an error too (and vice versa)

================

1/ What is the HTTP API for this?

$BASE_URL/

* Create a new game:
POST /game
  get back a game-id (xxxx)

-v gives response code and more info on the req

  curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/game
  GET is the default for curl
  2053f2cd-c692-49b7-ab36-3f398c98f3ba
  curl -v http://localhost:8080/game/doesnt-exist
GAME_ID=$(curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/game) ; curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/game/$GAME_ID/X/6

curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/game/$GAME_ID/O/3

problems:
- ends with draw, need to figure out where to put that
- Spot is taken. message instead of "not your turn". however any attempt to
overwrite that spot is now unavailable
- overwrote a spot



* Get the current state of a game
GET /game/{game-id}
  -> text, eg:
//        x |__|__
//        __|__|__
//          |   |
O to play

  -> json (can do this later, for web front-end)


* Make a move
POST /game/{game-id}/{piece}/{position}
display the current state of the game once you moved?

  -> text, eg:
 x |___|_O_
_O_|_X_|___
   |   | X
X has won
game logic:
if 123, 147, etc... then {position} won


  -> errors. it's not your turn, that space isn't available, the game is finished (409).
  -> that game doesn't exist (404)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/409

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

- can make a list in the future instead of cell1, cell2, etc









2/ How do we represent board/moves/wins etc in code?
